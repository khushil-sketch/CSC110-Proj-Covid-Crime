# Project Covid-Crime

This project aimed to explore the correlation between Covid-19 and Crime Cases in Canada over a span of 1.5 years, from March 2019 to August 2020. The investigation went beyond overall Crime Cases and delved into four distinct categories: Physical, Non-Physical, Public, and Private.

To conduct the analysis, data for both Covid cases and Crime rates were obtained from Statistics Canada in CSV format. Python's CSV and Datetime libraries were employed to parse and prepare the data, which involved cleaning and extracting relevant columns. 

The Pandas library was then utilized to further clean the data, including selecting specific columns for analysis and creating Pandas dataframes to work with. These dataframes served as the basis for generating scatterplots, plotting Covid Cases against Crime Cases.

Additionally, Numpy was employed to perform regression analysis on the data, providing insights into the relationship between Covid-19 and Crime Cases. The regression analysis results were visualized using a Regression plot, allowing for a clearer understanding of any potential correlations or trends.

Finally, an interactive front-end Tkinter application was designed to let users interact with the project findings.
